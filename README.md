This GitHub repository hosts a collection of implementations showcasing various approaches to implementing Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters. The IIR filter serves as a fundamental component within telecommunication systems, pivotal for signal processing tasks.
The repository explores the efficacy of employing different pipeline depths to enhance the speed of circuit designs. Each implementation demonstrates the IIR filter's functionality while employing distinct pipeline methods, thereby offering insights into their comparative speeds.
Notably, the IIR filter is structured in the form of biquad filters in one of the designs. These designs have undergone meticulous modeling using MATLAB Simulink and transitioning from floating-point to fixed-point units before hardware design and implementation on FPGA, ensuring accuracy and reliability in their functionality.
